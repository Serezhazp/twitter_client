# twitter_client
**Android client application for Twitter.**

To start using this app you should add Twitter key and secret to the local.properties

twitter_key="your_twitter_key"
twitter_secret="your_twitter_secret"

**Unit tests:**

According to some issue in Moxy (MVP library) launching unit tests in a presentation module causes errors, use **tests.sh** (located in a root project directory) script to launch tests instead.
